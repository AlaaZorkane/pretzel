# Pretzel
A small project I'm creating with ReactJS. If you'd like to contribute, you can either open a github issue or message me privately on Facebook.

## Alpha
Keep in mind that version is still on the **alpha** phase, that means that it's still filled with bugs and not all features are available. It's also on *limited early access*.

## My hopes
I am starting this project out of the reason that there are no free cloud streaming music players out there, so the heck with it, why don't I create one? Also, I wanted to make myself more comfortable with ReactJS and NodeJS for other big projects I'm building.

### Got Any questions?
